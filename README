SETUP
-----
1. Create the database (assuming root is your root user):
	mysqladmin create -uroot rs_php

2. Create Tables:
	mysql -uroot rs_php < settings.sql
	mysql -uroot rs_php < documents.sql
	mysql -uroot rs_php < templates.sql
	mysql -uroot rs_php < users.sql

3. Get your API tokens from RightSignature.com, set the Callback URL to be to'/setup/callback.php' ex. "http://localhost:8888/setup/oauth_callback.php"

4. Copy 'config/creds.php.example' to 'config/creds.php' and update credentials in config/creds.php

5. Get generate Request Token, visit authentication url, save OAuth Access Token and Verifier to settings table. There is a page that will do this for you:
	/setup/save_rs_access.php

6. Run your favorite webserver and host the files minus the 'setup' directory
